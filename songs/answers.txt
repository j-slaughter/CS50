Running the command: SELECT AVG(energy), AVG(valence), AVG(danceabilty) FROM songs;
gives me back a table with AVG(energy) = 0.65906, AVG(valence) = 0.484443, and
AVG(danceability) = 0.71646. Therefore, I would characterize the listeners audio aura
as generally happy go-lucky.

This, however, may not be representive of the listener because I am taking the average
of the songs and if the listener uses Spotify to listen to sad music and also for gym workouts,
then their averages will be skewed. A better method would be to calculate aura by
average genre of the songs or using the current data available to us in this database,
the average count of songs within a predetermine range of energy, valence, and danceability.
So if there are more songs in the lower range of energy, valence, and danceability, our aura will
correctly characterize the listener as "sad", even if they occasionally listen to more upbeat workout
music.
