Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

As the number of stimulations increased, the chance of lower rated teams winning decreased.
So starting at 10000 stimulations, their chance of winning was starting to return 0.0%.
This could be a fallacy in the fact that in real-world situation, they could still have a marginal chance at success.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

The predictions started to stabilize after 1000 stimulations.
This is while still maintaining a relative quick run time.
Therefore, I would call the predictions "good enough" after 1000 stimulations.
